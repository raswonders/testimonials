CSS
-
* percentage offset in nudge properties (left,top..) doesn't work for elements (position: absolute)
* elements (position: absolute) can have their location specified as a span. For instance span specified as
(top: 0; bottom: 0) will allocate all vertical space within its positional reference parent. With position span we can use
margin to align element in the center;
* to make container grow with its child we can make child parent's content and use fit-content as dimension of a parent
* marking part of the text with block element will break the line
* should not change html attributes

JS
-
* DOM: we can access DOM style properties via elem.style
* DOM: setAttribute() method - use for setting html attributes

SVG
-
* we can save SVG sprites as a separate svg files and use mere refernces via ID to them
